## The Premise
Shockball is a physical ball sport, where two teams try to outscore the other. The game of Shockball has evolved over time, from a primitive form to a more elaborate one; the modern version is played by four players in three roles: one guard, two wings, and a center. The play takes place in a confined space, and scoring is done by throwing a ball into a goal area. The team with the highest score at the end the game is the winner. For more detailed context and community-maintained history of the sport, see the [holocron entry here](http://holocron.swcombine.com/wiki/Shockball).

## Game Concepts
* Every team has 4 players on the field at any time: 1 Guard, 1 Left wing, 1 Right wing, and 1 Center.
* Every role has a preferred balance of skills, but every skill will be used on every role. (see below) <!-- TODO -->
* There are no fixed roles. You are not **classed** as a Guard, you **play as** a Guard in a given match. The coach can choose where they want you to play, and your player will function in that role. If you are playing as a Center, better have high value on Shooting and you will do well. But if your Blocking is low and you are playing as a Guard then you may not fare so well.
* Maximum points on a skill is 100
* Player substitution happens when players become fatigued (which is often). If you are not a starter, you'll play when the starter gets fatigued.
* The same 4 players remain on the field whether their side is attacking or defending. A Center will defend against the opposite guard, for example.
* Shockball is mainly a man-to-man play with fixed "pairs" and roles: 
  * home guard -- away center
  * home left wing -- away right wing
  * home right wing -- away left wing
  * home center -- away guard
* Shockball is also fast paced and dynamic, so it's possible that on a particular action a Wing may defend against the Guard, for example, or a Guard may try to score.

#### Flow of the match
Shockball Matches are broken into four periods of time. Each period takes 5 minutes of real time. A new game action is generated every 5 seconds (60 per period/240 per game). An action involves two opposing players each trying to achieve an outcome: a shot, pass, block, or tackle. The outcomes are calculated based on a number of variables and in no small part depend on each player's skills.

> Example Guard skill distribution 

A shockball player's capability and effectiveness is broken down into several categories. Understanding these and their significance will help you as you create your player. If you read the Premise at the top of these rules you will already know that there are three kinds of positions on the field - Center, Wing, and Guard. Here are the categories of skills.

#### Technical Skills
These will determine how well you perform in a particular game action. They also effect your player's position on the field, and how successfully they are in ideal position.
* **Shoot** - Your ability to score. When you try to throw the ball toward the goal, you will use the Shoot skill. In addition to your role, this skill will determine how many times you'll try to score: the higher it is compared to your Pass skill, the higher your chance of Shooting. Center's main skill.
* **Pass** - Your ability to pass the ball. When you try to pass the ball to a teammate, you will use the Pass skill. In addition to your role, this skill will determine how many times you'll pass the ball: the higher it is compared to your Shoot skill, the higher your chance of Passing. Wing's main skill.
* **Block** - Your ability to block a player. When you try to defend against a Pass or a Shot, you will use the Block skill. Guard's main skill.

#### Mental Skills
* **Vision** - Your ability to "read" the game and your opponent. The higher Vision you have, the higher is your chance of success on tight actions, because you are able to choose the better possible move. Practically: If your final "value" in an action is slightly inferior to your opponent's as higher Vision can turn the result on your favor.
* **Leadership** - Your ability to guide the team and impose your personality. The sum of all fielded team players' Leadership skills will affect the team's playing. The captain's Leadership will be multiplied when playing. In the future, conflicts may arise between players with high Leadership levels.

#### Physical Skills
* **Toughness** - Your resistance to tackles and tackling effects on your Fatigue. Every time a player play rough on you, or the other way round, Toughness determines whether you will be hurt and to what extent (although technically injuries lasting beyond a match are not implemented).
* **Agility** - Your ability to do rapid whole body movement with change of velocity or direction in response to a stimulus. Agility determines mainly if you succeed on a tackling/shocking attempt, or succeed on escaping it.
* **Endurance** - Your ability to resist Fatigue. The higher Endurance, the less fatigued you'll get. More Endurance means more time on the field. This skill is heavily effected by training (plus).

### Modifiers
There are a few other attributes of a Player that effect how they play and progress.
* **Aggressiveness** - Your attitude toward rough play. You'll set your Aggressiveness how you prefer before each match. The higher Aggressiveness, the rougher you'll play. Playing rough increases your chances of success on the actions dramatically; plus you can weaken your opponent. Drawbacks are that you will Fatigue faster; you'll increase the chance to Foul your opponent which gives them ball possession or even some free throws.
* **Experience** - Pretty self-explanatory, isn't it? Applies to every aspect of shockball. Experience increases slightly but steadily over time. Playing and training will add XP points. Cannot decrease, starts from 5 on player's creation and will be updated automatically.
* **Fatigue** - The inability to continue functioning at the level of one's normal abilities. This effects every aspect of match play, worsening other skills. Fatigue increases during play at a pace defined by Endurance. Rough plays and hits suffered effects it heavily. When benched you'll recover at a pace defined by your Endurance. Resets to 0 at the beginning of every match and will be updated automatically.

### Skill Progression
During player creation you will select number values for each skill, but thereafter you will not see that number. Instead, you will see an adjective that describes your ability. These are skill's level. Every level is equal to actual skill points, divided by 5 and rounded. Here are the levels in order of worst to best:

| Level          | Adjective                                        |

## Training your Player
Players are responsible for training themselves each week and managing their Aggressiveness before each match.

### Aggressiveness
Every player must set their Aggressiveness for the incoming match every week. If you don't set your aggressiveness, we assume that you agree completely with your coach and set your aggressiveness accordingly.

There are 11 levels of aggressiveness you can choose from, ranging from 0% (no aggressiveness at all) to 100% (maximum possible aggressiveness). Previous weeks settings are irrelevant. You can always choose freely your level every week.

The actual aggressiveness you'll have on the field depends on your individual level **and** your team's overall aggressiveness levels. The team aggression levels will be decided by the coach who can change it at will during the week. The more different your individual aggressiveness level and the average team levels are, the more your actual aggressiveness will tend towards your individual settings. If you want, you could think of your aggressiveness as a "force" that "pulls away" from the team aggression level. If the team's one is 40 and mine is 50; my actual aggressiveness will be something like 41; but if mine is 100, my actual aggressiveness will be 97 (values are not a true representation of the real equations).

#### Training
Every player must train during the week; this will keep your in shape and improve your stats. If you don't set a training routine you'll not train that week. If you don't train you won't improve your skills AND will lose conditioning. That means: slight loss of Endurance and slight loss of Agility and Toughness. 

The minimum value for a skill is 0 points. 0 is the lowest a skill can be (cannot go negative).

Every week you may decide what skill you want to train and the intensity of the routine. Different skills improve differently and have different side effects bound to the intensity. Every skill can be trained using three different intensity: Light, Medium, Heavy.

The "+" in the chart below refers to the relative value *increase* of a skill point whereas the "-" is a relative value *decrease* of a skill point. These do not represent whole numbers of skill points, but rather fractional amounts.

| Trained Skill  | Light Gain | Medium Gain | Heavy Gain | Decay Skill | Light Loss | Medium Loss | Heavy Loss | 
| :------------- | :--------: | :---------: | :--------: | :---------: | :--------: | :---------: | :--------: |
| Pass           | ++         | ++++        | ++++++     | Endurance   | /          | --          | ------     |
| Throw          | ++         | ++++        | ++++++     | Endurance   | /          | --          | ------     |
| Block          | ++         | ++++        | ++++++     | Endurance   | /          | --          | ------     |
| Vision         | ++         | ++++        | ++++++     | Endurance   | /          | --          | ------     |
| Endurance      | +          | ++          | ++++       | Vision      | /          | -           | ---        |
| Agility        | +          | ++          | +++        | Toughness   | /          | -           | --         |
| Toughness      | +          | ++          | +++        | Agility     | /          | -           | --         |
| Leadership     | +          | ++          | +++        | See Note*   | /          | *           | *          |

> Note: Training Leadership means you cannot train physically. If you choose to do so you'll suffer a loss equivalent to a - on one random skill if you train with medium intensity, and two skills if you train hard. Or you could happen to lose two - on the same skill.

Additionally, the previous weeks trainings or losses due to leadership training or lack of training can be seen in your player notifications.

## Fouls
Shockball is a rough game. Tackling is good, and the crowd loves it. This is a core feature of the sport, but meaningless or unskillfull slaughter is not allowed, or forgiven. While it is perfectly acceptable and accepted that a defender tries to break their opponent in two with a nice clean tackle, it's not so for dirty tricks, over-rough play, and intentional hits.

#### What you may do 
* A player can hit their opponent hard and still be perfectly in line with the spirit of the game. The hit has to be made when the ball is in the proximity of the hit opponent (that means close enough to be playable, or for it to be clear enough that the hit player was the absolutely intended receiver of the ball), in their possession, or immediately after it has been released for a pass or shot (this means that the hitting player did not have the opportunity to stop after they began the tackling action).
* Players can wrestle for the ball as long as they manage to grab it cleanly enough without grappling the player themselves (what this means is that defenders should aim to grab the ball, not the arm).
* Players can push/shove themselves as long as it is clear enough they are going after the ball and not for other reasons.

#### What you may **not** do
* Players are not allowed to grab, grapple, hit, trip, or hold a player when the ball is away and not clearly reaching the opponent.
* In no way will violent play or unnecessary roughness be allowed on the field.
* Shockball is a 1-on-1 game: you can defend in Zone or man-to-man mode, but still 1 vs 1. Doubling up on an attacker is not allowed.
* Players may not willingly go for hits to dangerous spots on the opponent's body, like eyes, genitals, or throat.
* Verbal exchanges of opinion are unavoidable during the game, but continuous verbal harassment of a player is not allowed.
