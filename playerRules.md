PLAYER CREATION AND SKILLS
--------------------------

#### USEFUL GAME CONCEPTS REFERENCE

*   Every team has 4 players on the field: Guard, Left wing, Right wing, Center.
*   Every role has a preferred skills balance, but every skill will be used on every role. (see below).
*   There are no fixed roles: you ARE NOT a guard, you PLAY AS a guard; the coach can choose where he wants you to play. If you will play as a center, better have high value on throwing, but you can still play on every position
*   Maximum points on a skill is 100.
*   Formation subs are frequent because of fatigue. If you are not a starter, you'll play when the starter get fatigued.
*   Same players are on the field both on offense actions and defense ones: a center will defend against opposite guard, for example.
*   Shockball is mainly a man-to-man play with fixed "pairs" and roles: guard-center, Left wing-right wing and so on; but is also fast paced and dynamic, so it's possible that, on a particular action, a wing defend against the guard, for example, or a guard decide to try to score.  

SKILLS DESCRIPTION
------------------

### TECHNICAL SKILLS

These will determine how well you play every game action type. They will determine your best position on the field, too.

#### THROWING

Your ability to score. When you will try to throw the ball toward the goal, you will use this skill.  
In addition to your role, this skill will determine how many times you'll try to score: the higher it is compared to your passing skill, the higher your chance of throwing.  
Center's main skill.  
  

#### PASSING

Your ability to pass the ball. When you will try to pass the ball to a teammate, you will use this skill.  
In addition to your role, this skill will determine how many times you'll pass the ball: the higher it is compared to your throwing skill, the higher your chance of passing.  
Wing's main skill.  
  

#### BLOCKING

Your ability to block a player. When you will try to defend over a pass or a throw, you will use this skill.  
Guard's main skill.  

### PHYSICAL SKILLS

#### TOUGHNESS

Your resistance to injuries. Every time a player play rough on you, or the other way round, this skill determines wether you will be hurt and to what extent.  

#### AGILITY

Your agility is the ability to do rapid whole body movement with change of velocity or direction in response to a stimulus.  
This skill determines mainly if you succeed on a tackling/shocking attempt, or succeed on escaping it.  

#### ENDURANCE

Your ability to resist fatigue. Higher the skill, less fatigued you'll get.  
More endurance means more time on the field.  
This skill is heavily affected by training (plus) and injuries (minus).  

### MENTAL SKILLS

#### VISION

Your ability to "read" the game and your opponent. The higer the skill, the higher is your chance of success on tight actions, because you are able to choose the better possible move.  
Practically: If your final "value" in an action is slightly inferior to your opponent's, an higher vision can turn the result on your favor.  

#### LEADERSHIP

Your ability to guide the team and impose your personality. The overall sum of leadership skills on the field will affect the team's playing. The captain's leadership will be multiplied when playing.  
In the future, conflicts may arise between players with high leadership levels.  
  

### MODIFIERS

  

#### AGGRESSIVENESS

Your attitude toward the rough play.The higher it is, the rougher you'll play. Playing rough increases your chances of success on the actions dramatically; plus you can weak your opponent or even throw him out of the field injured.  
Drawbacks are: you will fatigue faster; you'll increase the chance to foul your opponent, giving them ball possession, or even some free throws; You'll risk to be injured (SoonTM).  
Being an attitude, you'll set it freely every time you want.  
  

#### EXPERIENCE

Pretty self explanatory, isn't it? Applies to every aspect of the playing.  
Increases slightly but steadily over time. Playing and training will add XP points.  
Cannot decrease, starts from 5 on player's creation and will be updated automatically.  

#### FATIGUE

The inability to continue functioning at the level of one's normal abilities.  
Affect every aspect of the play, worsening them.  
Increase during the play at a pace defined by endurance.  
Rough plays and hits suffered affects it heavily.  
When benched you'll recover at a pace defined by your endurance.  
Starts at 100 at the beginning of every match and will be updated automatically.  

#### MORALE (not implemented yet)

Your spirit and aptitude. Will change according to team results, time playing, your stats, mixed stuff  

### SKILLS LEVELS

Once you choose your starting skills, you'll never be able to see them directly again. Instead, you'll see an adjective that describe your ability.  
These are skill's levels. Every level is equal to actual skill points, divided by 5 and rounded:

PLAYER'S WEEKLY ROUTINE
-----------------------

### Aggressiveness

Every player must set his aggressiveness attitude for the incoming match every week.  
If you don't set your aggressiveness, we assume that you agree completely with your coach and set your aggressiveness accordingly.

There are 11 levels of aggressiveness you can choose from, ranging from 0% (no aggressiveness at all) to 100% (maximum possible aggressiveness). Previous weeks settings are irrilevant: you can always choose freely your level every week.

The actual aggressiveness you'll have on the field depends on your attitude AND overall team attitude. The team attitude will be decided by the coach, who can change it at will during the week.  
You can always know the overall aggressiveness level because it's displayed right on top of yours on the page. The more distant those two attitudes are, the more your actual attitude will tend toward your personal settings.  
If you want, you could think of your attitude as a "force" that "pulls away" from the team attitude. If the team's one is 40 and mine is 50; my actual aggressiveness will be something like 41; but if mine is 100, my actual aggressiveness will be 97 (values are not a true representation of the real equations).

### Training

Every player must train during the week; this will keep him in shape and improve his stats.

If you don't set a training routine you'll not train that week. If you don't train you won't improve your skills AND will lose conditioning; that means: slight loss of endurance and slight loss of agility and toughness.

The minimum value for a skill is 0 points (see above for diference between skill points and skill levels). If any operation leads to negative skill, that skill will be leveled to 0.

Every week you could decide what skill you want to train and the intensity of the routine. Different skills improve differently and have different side effects bound to the intensity. Every skill could be trained using three different intensity: Light, Medium, Heavy. Refer to the table below.

\* NOTE: Training leadership means you cannot train phisically. If you choose to do so, you'll suffer a loss equivalent to a - on one random skill if you train with medium intensity, and two skills if you train hard. Could happen to lose two - on the same skill.

Last weeks trainings and eventual random losses due to leadership training or lack of training could be seen on your personal holopad.

FOULS
-----

Season 2 introduces Fouls, too.  
Tough play is the core of Shockball, but meaningless or unskillfull slaughter is not allowed, or forgiven.  
While it is perfectly acceptable, and accepted, that a defender tries to break his opponent in two with a nice and clean tackle, it's not so for dirty tricks, over-rough play, and intentional hits.  
  

### WHAT YOU CAN DO

Shockball is a tough game. tackling is good, and the crowd loves that.  

*   A player can hit his opponent hard and still be perfectly in line with the spirit of the game. The hit has to be handed out when the ball is in the proximity of the hit opponent (that means close enough to be playable, or for it to be clear enough that the hit player was the absolutely intended receiver of the ball), in his/her possession, or immediately after it has been released for a pass or shoot (this means that the hitting player did not have the opportunity to stop after he already begun the tackling action).
*   Players can wrestle for the ball as long as they manage to grab it cleanly enough, without grappling the player himself/herself (what this means is that defenders should aim to grab the ball, not the arm).
*   Players can push/shove themselves as long as it is clear enough they are going after the ball, and not for other reasons.

  
  

### WHAT YOU MAY NOT

*   Players are not allowed to grab, grapple, hit, trip or hold a player when the ball is away and not clearly reaching the opponent.
*   In no way will violent play or unnecessary roughness be allowed on the field
*   Shockball is a 1-on-1 game: you can defend in Zone or man-to-man mode, but still 1 vs 1. Doubling up on an attacker is not allowed
*   Players may not willingly go for hits to dangerous spots on the opponent's body, like eyes, genitals, throat
*   Verbal exchange of opinions are unavoidable during the game, but continuous verbal harassment of a player is not allowed

  
  

### THE FINES

Fouls are the breaking of the few rules above, and are listed under 3 categories; the main difference between them being the "fine" a team has to pay:  

*   Class 1 Light fouls: only cause a loss of the ball to the advantage of the opposing team.
*   Class 2 Medium fouls: more or less light fouls made when the attacker has thrown the ball towards the pit, or for anti-sportive behaviour on the field that doesn't involve violent actions (arguing, verbally harassing, pushing/shoving when the ball is away, or not in play). They are punished with 2 Free Throws against the fouling team.
*   Class 3 Hard fouls: intentional, hard fouls. Unnecessary roughness, anti-sportive behaviour that goes as far as actually hitting an opponent (means everything from hitting the opponent to free oneself for a better chance at shooting, to tripping an opponent going for the score, including all hits that are made with the ball close by, but intentionally hitting unallowed spots like face, genitals in whatever position they are found...). PUnished with 4 free Throws against the fouling team.
